# Undergraduate Project for Mark Asta Computational Materials Science Group
## Authors: Alan Liu and Wei Xie
### Studying effects of different GGA-functionals and van-der-waals corrections on energy calculations of various halide-perovskites.
### Python scripts to automate calculation of Distortion Angles are in the folder Octahedral_Distortion_Parameters. Most recently updated versions of scripts in the scripts directory. 
#### Some distortion angles calculated include in-plane, out-of-plane, and tilting-angle distortions.
